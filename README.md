## Week1

`week1` dir contains linear regression demo for the first week.

Just run it, click to create additional points and see how it converges.

// TODO: add a gif of the UI

## Week2

`week2` dir contains linear regression with multiple features demo for the second week. The implementation works with
any number of features, but we use 2 because human beings have troubles perceiving more than 3 dimensions.

You can left click the image and rotate it with the mouse and add points by the inputs on the bottom.

There 2 algorithms: linear regression and normal equation and you can switch between them by
changing `USE_NORMAL_EQUATION` in `src/constants.rs` file
