## Week 1

`week1` dir contains linear regression demo for the first week.

Just run it, click to create additional points and see how it converges.

// TODO: add a gif of the UI

## Week 2

`week2` dir contains linear regression with multiple features demo for the second week. The implementation works with
any number of features, but we use 2 because human beings have troubles perceiving more than 3 dimensions.

You can left click the image and rotate it with the mouse and add points by the inputs on the bottom.

There 2 algorithms: linear regression and normal equation and you can switch between them by
changing `USE_NORMAL_EQUATION` in `src/constants.rs` file

## Week 3

`week3` dir contains a demo for logistic regression with 1 and 2 features. For 2 features there's a 2d visualization
where x, y and size of the dot are original data. For 3 features we visualize points in 3d space and prediction function
as a sigmoid surface. You can add new points and see how the surface will get adjusted.

## Week 4

There's no demo for week 4 since week 5's demo includes the material from week 4.
